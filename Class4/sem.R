#Conditionals and loops
#FizzBuzz again!

#Print numbers from 1 to 100, if the number is divisible by 3, print Fizz
#instead, if the number is divisible by 5, print Buzz, if by both, print
#FizzBuzz
#Use loops and coniditinals!

#Make a function that will compute the nTh fibonacci number
#1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21... each number is the sum of the 2 previous ones

#Using recursion

#Using loops

#Using this function (in an inefficient manner), make a vector of first 50
#fibonacci numbers.

#Then estimate the ratios between consecutive numbers (this can be both done
#with loops and by vector/matrix manipulation)

#Plot this vector as a line
