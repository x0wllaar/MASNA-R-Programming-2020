                                        # Problem 1
## 2 varibles, x and y have some values in them
x <- 1
y <- 2
## Write a snippet of code that will swat their values

                                        # Problem 2
## We have variables
a <- 4.5
b <- "3,145"
c <- 2.36
d <- TRUE

## What are their types

## Convert variable d to an integer

## Convert variable b to numeric (watch the comma)

## Convert variable a to a string (character)

## Convert veriable c to integer

                                        # Problem 3
f <- "23456,89"
## Using all the necessary conversions and functions, save the natural
## log of the value to the variable l_f

                                        #Problem 4
## We have a vector of values
v <- c(1, 0, 2, 3, 6, 8, 12, 15, 0, NA, NA, 9, 4, 16, 2, 0)

                                        # Problem 4a
## Show
## The fisrt element of v

## The last element of v

## Elements of v form the 2nd to 6th inclusive

## Elements of v that are bigger than 2

## Elements of v that are divisible by 3

## Elements of v that are both divisible by 3 and greater than 2

## Elements of v that are either less than 5 or greater then 10

                                        # Problem 4b
## Replace the second to last value of v with 10
## The code should work for vectors of all lengths

                                        # Problem 4c
## Show indices of NA's in v

## Count NA's in v without using which

                                        # Problem 5
## We have a vector
v_2 <- c(15000, 22000, 25000, 190000, 64000, 1514)
## Convert this vector to a factor vector
## With value 1 if the value in v_2 is above
## and 0 if the value in v_2 is at or below average
## DO NOT USE THE mean FUNCTION

                                        # Problem 6
## FizzBuzz
## Write code that will print all numbers from 1 to 100, but
## 1) If the number is divisible by 3, it will print Fizz instead
## 2) If the number is divisible by 5, it will print Buzz instead
## 3) If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, it will print FizzBuzz instead
